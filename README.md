# bulletscreen/canvas

Now, bullet screen is everywhere, especially in most live video websites. It gives the visitors a good way to communicate with each other and swap their ideas of something in the video.
Actually, before using Canvas, we can only use CSS3 and JS to achieve this effect. That's fine, anyway, we often use animations of CSS3 and JS to finish some stunning effects. However, when it comes to large number of bullet text, we have to add more "div", which may let the screen be lagging. More worse, the more bullet text, the screen will be more lagging.  But now, the Canvas skill will overcome it perfectly, and it will use less code and more easily to read. 
As far as I know, some good video websites have changed their code of bullet screen from CSS3 to the Canvas. Such as bilibili, huya and so on. 

In this repository, I just write a small case of bullet screen by using Canvas skill. It's easy to read, and this case is supported by IE9+, Chrome, Safari, Opera, Firefox and  mobile devices. In this case, you can also send your own bullet text, and it will be showed in the screen immediately.  

A little shortcoming is that this case has no video because these days my time is limited, but the main function has been put into this case. Anyway, please forgive me, I will find time to put another great case with a video.
